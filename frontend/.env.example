# Frontend Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values

# Backend API URL (for separate hosting on Render)
# IMPORTANT: Can be with or without /api - code will append /api automatically
# Option 1 (recommended): Full URL with /api
# Example: https://your-backend-name.onrender.com/api
# Option 2: Base URL without /api (code will append it)
# Example: https://your-backend-name.onrender.com
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-name.onrender.com/api

# Note: In Netlify, set this as an environment variable in the dashboardz
# Variable name: VITE_API_URL
# Value: https://your-backend-name.onrender.com/api (or without /api, both work)
